# icon-composer-examples

A repo for sharing [Icon Composer](https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer/) icons, so we can share our techniques. Pull requests welcome.

Icons are for learning only, and copyright belongs to the original artists.

### Example

Icons should illustrate something slightly outside of a typical “glyph over a color” - for example, this icon attempts to copy the TestFlight icon, with a matching grid, and similar variances in light and dark mode.

| Light | Dark |

| ![Paku Blueprint Light](Paku-Blueprint-Light.png) | ![Paku Blueprint Dark](Paku-Blueprint-Dark.png) |
